            <h3>Why I Want to Work at Anthropic</h3>
  <p>I once read that you can do anything, you just need to go out there and find the longest lever you can. I see it as my duty to contribute, to the best of my ability, in ways which I believe will make the world better. I see Anthropic as my longest lever to do that.</p>
  
  <p>Five years ago, I wrote a paper arguing that AI shouldn’t replace human judges because it would be unsafe to do so. At the time, AI models were black boxes. We would not be able to trust their judgments if we could not understand how they worked. Judgments must not only be just, but fair—and fairness is something we feel. For judgments to feel fair, we need to be able to interpret and understand how a decision is made.</p>
  
  <p>Now, I realize that interpretability is necessary not only for us to trust the models, but for them to be built in a safe and reliable way. Anthropic’s work on interpretability and emphasis on safety and reliability may now allow AI models to replace human judges—in delivering both said fairness and correctness—but also much more. As an end user, I trust Claude because I know they are built reliably and safely, and in turn rely on it much more than other assistants. Claude feels like a collaborator, which is testament to the team’s work in training and finetuning its models (including its character).</p>
  
  <p>I am particularly interested in developing products that leverage the team’s advanced interpretability research to create more safe and trustworthy user experiences. My experience launching products from 0–1 and training in law positions me to develop Anthropic’s vision in ways that balance between what is useful to users and beneficial to society. I am motivated to find the longest lever I can, and to do it urgently and with rigor. <a href="#" onclick="document.querySelectorAll('section').forEach(s => s.classList.remove('active')); document.getElementById('skills').classList.add('active'); return false;">My specific skills and experience align directly with these goals.</a></p>

                <li><strong>skilled in 0-1 development:</strong> launched multiple 0-1 products across healthtech, gaming, and AI</li>
                <li><strong>self-starter in ambiguous environments:</strong> led product development across diverse domains from concept to market, consistently delivering results in uncharted territory (achieved 100K downloads within three months, launched the first AI video analysis platform used in a live legal deposition)</li>
                <li><strong>data-driven:</strong> established experimentation frameworks that increased efficiency and enabled rapid iteration, with measurable impact on user retention and revenue</li>
                <li><strong>user-focused:</strong> conducted hundreds of user interviews and built user communities that drove industry-leading retention while collaborating with domain experts</li>
                <li><strong>cross-functional collaborator:</strong> led teams across AI, engineering, design, and go-to-market, defining strategic roadmaps and aligning priorities with stakeholders</li>
